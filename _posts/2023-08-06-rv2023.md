Temporal logics are widely used in runtime verification as they enable the creation of declarative
and compositional specifications. However, their ability to model complex data is limited. One must
resort to complicated encoding schemes to express properties involving basic structures such as
lists or trees. To avoid this drawback, we extend metric first-order temporal logic with a
minimalistic, yet expressive, functional programming language. The extension features an expressive
collection of types including function, record, variant, and inductive types, as well as support for
type inference and monitoring.

Our monitor implementation directly parses traces in the JSON format, based on the user's type
specification, which avoids a separate pre-processing step. We compare our approach to existing
shallow embeddings of temporal properties in general-purpose host languages and to encodings into
simple temporal logics. Specifically, our language benefits from a precise semantics and a good
support for monitoring-specific static analysis.
