This report presents the activities of the first working group of the
COST Action ArVI, Runtime Verification beyond Monitoring. The report aims
to provide an overview of some of the major core aspects involved in Runtime
Verification. Runtime Verification is the field of research dedicated to the analysis
of system executions. It is often seen as a discipline that studies how a system run
satisfies or violates correctness properties.
The report exposes a taxonomy of Runtime Verification (RV) presenting the terminology involved with the main concepts of the field. The report also develops the concept of instrumentation, the various ways to instrument systems, and
the fundamental role of instrumentation in designing an RV framework. We also
discuss how RV interplays with other verification techniques such as modelchecking, deductive verification, model learning, testing, and runtime assertion
checking. Finally, we propose challenges in monitoring quantitative and statistical data beyond detecting property violation.
