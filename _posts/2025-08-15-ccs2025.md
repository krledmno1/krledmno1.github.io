Privacy by design requires integrating data protection into systems from the outset, during their
design, rather than building it in later. Related legislation does not specify how to achieve this
and mainstream languages and frameworks lack support for privacy by design. To address this
long-standing problem, we have developed different, effective technical solutions. First, we have
developed powerful logic-based tools that enforce formal data protection policies at runtime by
controlling relevant system actions. Second, we have proposed methods and tools for integrating
privacy models into system design models, enabling model-driven privacy enforcement. We report on
our methods, tools, and practical experiences using them.
