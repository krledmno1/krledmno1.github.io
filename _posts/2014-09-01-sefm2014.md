Modern complex software systems produce a large amount of execution data, often stored in logs. These logs can be analyzed using trace checking
techniques to check whether the system complies with its requirements specifications. Often these specifications express quantitative properties of the system,
which include timing constraints as well as higher-level constraints on the occurrences of significant events, expressed using aggregate operators.
In this paper we present an algorithm that exploits the MapReduce programming
model to check specifications expressed in a metric temporal logic with aggregating modalities, over large execution traces. The algorithm exploits the structure of
the formula to parallelize the evaluation, with a significant gain in time. We report
on the assesment of the implementation—based on the Hadoop framework—of
the proposed algorithm and comment on its scalability.
