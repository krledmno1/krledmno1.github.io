Service-based applications are often developed as
compositions of partner services. A service integrator needs
precise methods to specify the quality attributes expected by
each partner service, as well as effective techniques to verify
these attributes. In previous work, we identified the most common specification patterns related to provisioning service-based
applications and developed an expressive specification language
(SOLOIST) that supports them. SOLOIST is an extension of
metric temporal logic with aggregate temporal modalities that
can be used to write quantitative temporal properties.
In this paper we address the problem of performing offline checking of service execution traces against quantitative
requirements specifications written in SOLOIST. We present a
translation of SOLOIST into CLTLB(D), a variant of linear
temporal logic, and reduce the trace checking of SOLOIST to
bounded satisfiability checking of CLTLB(D), which is supported
by ZOT, an SMT-based verification toolkit. We detail the results
of applying the proposed offline trace checking procedure to
different types of traces, and compare its performance with
previous work.
