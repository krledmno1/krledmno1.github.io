Modern software systems must comply with increasingly complex regulations in domains ranging from
industrial automation to data protection. Runtime enforcement addresses this challenge by empowering
systems to not only observe, but also actively control, the behavior of target systems by modifying
their actions to ensure policy compliance. 

We propose a novel approach to the proactive real-time enforcement of policies expressed in metric
first-order temporal logic (MFOTL). We introduce a new system model, define an expressive MFOTL
fragment that is enforceable in that model, and develop a sound enforcement algorithm for this
fragment. We implement this algorithm in a tool called WhyEnf and carry out a case study on
enforcing GDPR-related policies. Our tool can enforce all policies from the study in real-time with
modest overhead. Our work thus provides the first tool-supported approach that can proactively
enforce expressive first-order policies in real time.
