While Privacy by Design (PbD) is prescribed by modern privacy regulations such as 
the EU's GDPR, achieving PbD in real software systems is a notoriously difficult 
task. One emerging technique to realize PbD is Runtime enforcement (RE), in which 
an enforcer, loaded with a specification of a system's privacy requirements, 
observes the actions performed by the system and instructs it to perform actions 
that will ensure compliance with these requirements at all times. 

To be able to use RE techniques for PbD, privacy regulations first need to be 
translated into an enforceable specification. In this paper, we report on our ongoing 
work in formalizing the GDPR. We first present a set of requirements and an iterative 
methodology for creating enforceable formal specifications of legal provisions. Then, 
we report on a preliminary case study in which we used our methodology to derive an 
enforceable specification of part of the GDPR. Our case study suggests that our 
methodology can be effectively used to develop accurate enforceable specifications.
