We present a benchmark suite for generating and reproducing streams of time-stamped parametric events. The benchmark generates a stream according to user-defined char- acteristics and reproduces it at a user-defined velocity. The characteristics relate to the frequencies of the different events and their data values. The benchmark also provides the expected result of monitoring the generated streams against a family of first-order tem- poral specifications. We envision the benchmark being used to attest the performance of online first-order monitors.
