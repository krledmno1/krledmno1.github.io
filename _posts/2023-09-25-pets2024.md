We develop the first language-based, Privacy by Design approach that provides support for a rich
class of privacy policies. The policies are user-defined, rather than programmer-defined, and
combine fine-grained information flow restrictions (considering individual application inputs and
outputs) with temporal constraints. Our approach, called Taint, Track, and Control (TTC), combines
dynamic information-flow control and runtime verification to enforce these policies in the
presence of malicious users and developers.

We provide TTC’s semantics and proofs of its correct enforcement, formalized in the Isabelle/HOL
proof assistant. We also implement our approach in a web development framework and port three 
baseline applications from previous work into this framework for evaluation. Overall, our approach 
enforces expressive user-defined privacy policies with practical runtime performance.
