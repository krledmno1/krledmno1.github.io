Data ownership is the users' right to control how their personal data is used. Current approaches
for handling user data do not properly enforce data ownership. One major reason for this is that
service providers can both provision their services' code and execute it on user data that they
collected and stored on their own servers.

We propose the Databank model, a new architecture that separates data storage and code execution from code provisioning. Its main component, called a Databank, stores and processes user data. Users can define data-usage policies describing how their data may be processed, expressed as temporal constraints on service behavior. Service providers independently deploy code to the Databank writ- ten in a programming language that uses dynamic information-flow control (to track data during service execution) and runtime verification (to detect and prevent policy violations) to enforce user policies. Users thus obtain formal guarantees about the use of data they own.
We specify and implement the Databank. We evaluate our implementation on a proof-of-concept application, which attests to its generality, usability, and modest performance overhead.
