SMT solvers have been recently applied to bounded model checking
and satisfiability checking of metric temporal logic. In this paper we consider
SOLOIST, an extension of metric temporal logic with aggregate temporal modalities; it has been defined based on a field study on the use of specification patterns in the context of the provisioning of service-based applications. We apply
bounded satisfiability checking to perform trace checking of service execution
traces against requirements expressed in SOLOIST. In particular, we focus on
sparse traces, i.e., traces in which the number of time instants when events occur
is very low with respect to the length of the trace.
The main contribution of this paper is an encoding of SOLOIST formulae into
formulae of the theory of quantifier-free integer difference logic with uninterpreted function and predicate symbols. This encoding paves the way for efficient
checking of SOLOIST formulae over sparse traces using an SMT-based verification toolkit. We report on the evaluation of the proposed encoding, commenting
on its scalability and its effectiveness.
