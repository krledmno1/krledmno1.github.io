In this position paper we discuss the risk of tool over-tuning in
runtime verification competitions. We believe that the risk is
inherently enabled by the format of the competitions and we discuss it
in the context of the "First International Competition on Software
for Runtime Verification (CSRV2014)", in which we participated.
