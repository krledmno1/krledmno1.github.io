Violations of data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are ubiquitous.
Currently building IT support to implement such laws is difficult and the alternatives such as
manual controls augmented by auditing are limited and scale poorly. This calls for new automated
enforcement techniques that can build on, and enforce, a formalization of the law.

In this paper, we present the first enforceable specification of a core set of GDPR provisions,
centered on data-subject rights, and describe an architecture that automatically enforces this
specification in web applications. We evaluate our architecture by implementing three case studies
and show that our approach incurs only modest development and runtime overhead, while covering the
most relevant privacy-related aspects of GDPR that can be enforced at runtime.
