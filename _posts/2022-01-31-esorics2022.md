Correctness and regulatory compliance of today's software systems are crucial for our safety and
security. This can be achieved with policy enforcement: the process of monitoring and possibly
modifying system behavior to satisfy a given policy. The enforcer’s capabilities determine which
policies are enforceable. 

We study the enforceability of policies specified in metric first-order temporal logic (MFOTL) with
enforcers that can cause and suppress different system actions in real time. We consider an
expressive safety fragment of MFOTL and show that a policy from that fragment is enforceable if and
only if it is equivalent to a policy in a simpler, syntactically defined MFOTL fragment. We then
propose an enforcement algorithm for all monitorable policies from the latter fragment, and show
that our EnfPoly enforcer outperforms state-of-the-art tools.
