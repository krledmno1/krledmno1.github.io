Correctness and regulatory compliance of today's software systems are crucial for our safety and
security. This can be achieved with policy enforcement: the process of correcting system behavior to
satisfy a given policy. The enforcer's capabilities determine which policies are enforceable.

We study the enforceability of policies specified in metric first-order temporal logic (MFOTL) with enforcers that can cause and suppress different system actions in real time. We show that a formula from an expressive safety fragment of MFOTL is enforceable if and only if it is equivalent to a formula in a simpler, syntactically defined MFOTL fragment. We propose an enforcement algorithm for all monitorable formulae (i.e., formulae whose violations can be detected by manipulating finite sets of satisfying valuations) from the latter fragment, and show that our EnfPoly enforcer tool outperforms state-of-the-art enforcers.
