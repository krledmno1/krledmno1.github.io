Over the last 20 years Runtime Verification (RV) has grown into a diverse and active field, which has stimulated the development of numerous theoretical frameworks and tools. Many of the tools are at first sight very different and challenging to compare. Yet, there are similarities. In this work, we classify RV tools within a high-level taxonomy of concepts. We first present this taxonomy and discuss the different dimensions. Then, we survey RV tools and, where possible with the support of tool developers, classify them according to the taxonomy. This article constitutes a snapshot of the current state of the art and enables a comparison of existing tools.
