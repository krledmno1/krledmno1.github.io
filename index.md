As of December 2016 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Information Security group](https://infsec.ethz.ch) led by prof. [David Basin](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/basin/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html). I have obtained my PhD in 2016 at the [DeepSE research group](http://deepse.dei.polimi.it/) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) under prof. [Carlo Ghezzi](http://home.deib.polimi.it/ghezzi/)'s supervision. I have obtained my BSc degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the [Faculty of Electronic Engineering Niš](http://old.elfak.ni.ac.rs/en) and my MSc degree in Engineering Computing Systems at Politecnico di Milano. 
My main research interests include developing techniques and methodologies that enable specification and verification of complex software systems. 

Students interested in these fields are welcome to send me an email.

As for my first name: Srđan (or variants: Srdjan, Srdan) - I'm aware that some people have problems pronouncing it and I admit - it's a bit of a tongue twister. One solution is to use the (much easier) italian version: Sergio, the other is to practice (IPA: /Srd͡ʑan/):
